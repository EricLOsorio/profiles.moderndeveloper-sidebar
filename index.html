			<div class="description">
				<p>I have been in the IT field for over 15 years, mostly in the Sys Admin side. I am currently doing contract work as a systems engineer in a cyber security team. Web Developement is the next area of technology that I am exploring in order to combine my technical side with my more creative side. I've rarely been outside the U.S. although I was born in El Salvador and speak fluent Spanish. Living in different parts of the world while doing Web Development work is one of the goals I would love to accomplish in the next 5 years.</p>
